Avoid mirrors today. avoid caffine. Go to a restaurant (walking distance from your place of residence if possible). Go alone. look at the menu forwhat feels like a long time but then look a little bit longer. Evaluate your choices carefully. order what you think is in your best interest. its a new day today and its different from wednesday but that doenst mean the unexpected wont happen so keeep your eyes peeled. be wary of the waiter (hes seen a lot of people come in and out of this restaurant, DON'T mistake his Courtsey for friendship). Order kindly. Thank him nicely. Dip your fingers in the water to wash them and ask for a new glass. Chew ice. taste the salt and pepper. go to the bathroom and hang out there until your food is out. GO back and eat the food, think about each bite and feel grateful. think about what you will do tomorrow. If the waiter asks how it is tell the truth. Leave a big tip or not depending on your financial situation. Exit the restaurant. Walk home and make observations. Run. Unlock. Rest. Reguivinate. Drink a juice beverage. Tell your neighbor you need to borrow a cup of flour and be really polite about the whole thing to increase neighborly relations. Rest. Sit. Enjoy. Unwind. Shower. Lay your head down. Eyes closed. Time to shine. 

<p style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday</p>

It's your birthday! Time for some relaxing games and home-made beverages. Wear a cool outfit like a polo shirt and sunglasses. Make sure the top button on the polo shirt isn't too high up because that will make you look like  a nerd. There will be streamers and confettii. Don't try any vending machines today you will regret it for the rest of your life if you do
