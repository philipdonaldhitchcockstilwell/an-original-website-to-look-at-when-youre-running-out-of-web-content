<p><font color=gold size=2> Why are you firing me dale, 
I don't know what you mean when you say I don't know how to do my job correctly, Dale. 
I've stapled a lot of things together and put things in the file cabinet. I don't get 
why I have to lose my job over this. it was one mistake. Have you never made a mistake 
in your life? What do you mean I have to pay for my actions? I am very afraid of being 
thrashed just like everyone else in this office! Why single me out! I'm just a man on the line
. A man out in the cold, like a dog. Counting all the things I've ever done and wondering why, 
Dale. All I ever was was a man with a dream, and I've done every thing I could to keep the fire 
going, but I guess
 I can't stay on top forever. All good things must end after all. The cold, shallow, dirt cavities await
 us all, I suppose. I'll miss this place.
